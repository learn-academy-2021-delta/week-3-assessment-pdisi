# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: This is related to keys within Javascript classes. They help set the blueprint for the data and can be called upon in the render.

  Researched answer: This is a keyword that refers to an object that is is calling upon or that it otherwise belongs to. It seems to always relate to objects.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a library or framework, which the title is commonly argued about. It was created by Facebook and is commonly used in numerous applications today as it is the second most popular coding framework in the industry. It is especially good as separating code into components and being able to call upon them to work seamlessly with a primary JS file. A major benefit of react is its ability to refresh individual items on a webpage or application instead of refreshing the entire browser, which saves time and money.

  Researched answer: React is capable of handling the view layer or the first layer of the DOB and allows of seamless creation of interactive user interfaces.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: I am a having trouble recalling this, but I'd say the input.

  Researched answer: The only required method in a React class component is the render() method. Without this nothing will appear on the site page.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is the written language within React that is a combination between HTML and JS. One notable difference is the requirement for empty opening and closing tags around the render() in JSX

  Researched answer: HTML can return multiple elements at once while JSX must return one element, which is called a parent element that wraps all the child elements.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a script that loads required node modules into your folder in order to properly run React and other things like Jest.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager. With this packages it allows you to develop with JavaScript and easily share your work with other developers.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: The function who shall not be named. That's the extent of my guess!

  Researched answer: It seems like an anonymous function is implemented to be called on later by a variable.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Allows a website UI to render based upon a condition being true or false

2. Props: Props (properties) are used to pass data from one component to another within React

3. JavaScript Events: Interactive actions within a webpage are called events within JS. Loading, button clicks, resizing, etc.

4. Object oriented programming: OOB is based on assigning data and code to objects in the form of procedures. This is what we used for Austin's car example.

5. Ruby: Ruby is a coding language that was developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan during the 1990s. It is a flexibile lanaguage that is compared to Python for how easy the lanaguage is to understand and the elegance of its syntax.
